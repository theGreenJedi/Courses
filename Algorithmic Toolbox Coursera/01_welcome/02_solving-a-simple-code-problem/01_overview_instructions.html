  One of the main features of this class (and the whole specialization) is programming assignments. In these assignments, your goal is to implement an algorithm solving a given computational problem in less than a few seconds, even on large datasets. Solving programming assignments will equip you with a much deeper understanding of algorithms, give you experience in solving programming problems similar to those given during interviews at high-tech companies, and teach you to test and debug your solutions.
 </p>
 <p>
  To solve a programming assignment, you need to implement a program that reads input data from standard input and writes an answer to standard output. Your implementation will be checked automatically against a number of carefully selected tests. In particular, the testing system will check whether your solution always produces a correct answer and that it fits into the given time and memory limits.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have provided thorough test suites for all programming assignments to check all possible aspects where your solution might fail. It is important that you write programs that work correctly on all of the test datasets provided for a problem, and not just on most of these datasets. Why? In practice, failing to completely test your programs leads to bugs that bother your users, causing their experience to deteriorate significantly. Furthermore, mistakes that only appear occasionally can affect your entire project: you may obtain incorrect results when testing your hypotheses and believe in these results for a long time, basing your decisions on that belief, only to later find a bug.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have also prepared a few special programming assignments in the beginning of the course, which are accompanied with detailed readings and videos that will teach you to test your programs to ensure that they run correctly on all test cases.
