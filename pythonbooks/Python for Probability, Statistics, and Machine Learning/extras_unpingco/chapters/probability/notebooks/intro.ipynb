    "In grade school, you were introduced to the natural numbers (i.e., `1,2,3,..`)\n",
    "and you learned how to manipulate them by operations like addition,\n",
    "subtraction, and multiplication. Later, you were introduced to positive and\n",
    "negative numbers and were again taught how to manipulate them. Ultimately, you\n",
    "were introduced to the calculus of the real line, and learned how to\n",
    "differentiate, take limits, and so on. This progression provided more\n",
    "abstractions, but also widened the field of problems you could successfully\n",
