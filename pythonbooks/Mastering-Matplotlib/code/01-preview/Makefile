# The following target is intended for use by project-creators only. When
# creating a new notebook project, add a copy of this Makefile and run this
# target to get the includes set up:
#
# $ make setup-submodule
setup-submodule:
	git submodule add $(INCLUDE_REPO) $(INCLUDE_DIR)

# The 'setup' target needs to be run before the 'project-deps' target,
# so that the includes are present (done by 'make project-setup').
