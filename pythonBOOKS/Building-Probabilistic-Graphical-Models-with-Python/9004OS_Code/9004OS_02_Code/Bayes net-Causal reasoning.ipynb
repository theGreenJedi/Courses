      "In this section we shall look at different kinds of reasoning used in a Bayes Net. We shall use the libpgm library to create a Bayes net. Libpgm uses a JSON-formatted file with a specific format where the edges, vertices and the CPDs at each vertice are annotated. This json file is read into the NodeData and GraphSkeleton objects to create a DiscreteBayesianNetwork (which, as the name suggests is a Bayes net where the CPDs take on discrete values). The TableCPDFactorization is an object that wraps the DiscreteBayesianNetwork and allows us to query the CPDs in the network. Please copy the json file for this example, 'job_interview.txt' to a local folder and change the relevant line in the getTableCPD() function to refer your local path to job_interview.txt. \n",
      "\n",
      "The following discussion uses integers 0, 1, 2 for discrete outcomes of each random variable, where 0 is the worst outcome. For e.g, Interview=0 indicates the worst outcome of the interview and Interview=2 is the best outcome. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first kind of reasoning we shall explore is called 'Causal Reasoning'. Initially we observe the prior probability of an event unconditioned by any evidence(for this example, we shall focus on the 'Offer' random variable). We then introduce observations of (one of) the parent variables. Consistent with our logical reasoning, we note that if one of the parents (equivalent to causes) of an event are observed, then we have stronger beliefs about the Offer random variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "We start off by defining a function that reads the JSON data file and creating an object we can use to run probability queries on."
