This is a directory of program listings from Chapter 15 of the book:

<dt><i>Foundations of Python Network Programming</i></dt>
<dd>
Second Edition, December 2010<br>
by Brandon Rhodes and John Goerzen

The book **has now been superseded** by a Third Edition.

The new edition uses both better techniques
and takes advantage of more modern third party libraries.
Even though its focus is on Python 3, most of its scripts
will also work under Python 2 if processed with the
[3to2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2) tool.

To compare the scripts here with the equivalent scripts
in the Third Edition, visit:
