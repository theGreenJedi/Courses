    "There used to be a TV game show where the host would hide a prize behind\n",

    "However, before opening the door of the contestant's choice, the host\n",
    "would open one of the other doors and ask the contestant if she wanted to\n",
    "change her selection.  This is the classic *Monty Hall* problem. The\n",
    "question is should the contestant stay with her original choice or switch\n",
    "after seeing what the host has revealed?  From the information theory\n",
    "perspective, does the information environment change when the host reveals\n",
    "what is behind one of the doors?  The important detail here is that the\n",
    "host *never* opens the door with the prize behind it, regardless of the\n",
    "contestant's choice. That is, the host *knows* where the prize is, but he\n",

    " It is no accident that the entropy has this functional form\n",
    "as the expectation of $h(x)$. It leads to a deep and powerful theory\n",
    "of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get some intuition about what information entropy means, consider a sequence\n",
    "of three-bit numbers where each individual bit is equally likely. Thus, the\n",
    "individual information content of a single bit is $h(x) = \\log_2 (2) = 1$. The\n",
    "units of entropy are *bits* so this says that information content of a single bit\n",
    "is one bit. Because the three-bit number has elements that are mutually\n",
    "independent and equally likely, the information entropy of the\n",
    "three-bit number is $h(X) = 2^3 \\times  \\log_2(2^3)/8=3 $. Thus,\n",
    "the basic idea of information content at least makes sense at this level.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way to interpret this question is as how much information would I have\n",
    "to provide in order to uniquely encode an arbitrary three-bit number? In this\n",
    "case, you would have to answer three questions: *Is the first bit zero or one?\n",
    "Is the second bit zero or one? Is the third bit zero or one?* Answering\n",
    "these questions uniquely specifies the unknown three-bit number. Because the\n",
    "bits are mutually independent, knowing the state of any of the bits does not\n",
    "inform the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's consider a situation that lacks this mutual independence. Suppose\n",
    "in a group of nine otherwise identical balls there is a heavier  one.\n",
    "Furthermore, we also have a measuring scale that indicates whether one side is\n",
    "heavier, lighter, or equal to the other.  How could we identify the heavier\n",
    "ball? At the outset, the information content, which measures the uncertainty of\n",
    "the situation is $\\log_2(9)$ because one of the nine balls is heavier. [Figure](#fig:Information_Entropy_001) shows\n",
    "one strategy. We could arbitrarily select out one of the balls (shown by the\n",
    "square), leaving the remaining eight to be balanced. The thick, black\n",
    "horizontal line indicates the scale.  The items below and above this line\n",
    "indicate the counterbalanced sides of the scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- dom:FIGURE: [fig-probability/NineBall_01.jpg, width=500 frac=0.75] One heavy ball is hidden among eight identical balls. By weighing groups sequentially, we can determine the heavy ball. <div id=\"fig:Information_Entropy_001\"></div> -->\n",

    "If we get lucky, the scale will report that the group of four walls on either\n",
    "side of the balance are equal in weight. This means that the ball that was\n",
    "omitted is the heavier one. This is indicated by the hashed left-pointing\n",
    "arrow. In this case, all the uncertainty has evaporated, and the *informational\n",
    "value* of that one weighing is equal to $\\log_2(9)$.  In other words, the scale\n",
    "has reduced the uncertainty to zero (i.e., found the heavy ball). On the other\n",
    "hand, the scale could report that the upper group of four balls is heavier\n",
    "(black, upward-pointing arrow) or lighter (gray, downward-pointing arrow). In\n",
    "this case, we cannot isolate the heavier ball until we perform all of the\n",
    "indicated weighings, moving from left-to-right. Specifically, the four balls on\n",
    "the heavier side have to be split by a subsequent weighing into two balls and\n",
    "then to one ball before the heavy ball can be identified.  Thus, this process\n",
    "takes three weighings. The first one has information content $\\log_2(9/8)$, the\n",
    "next has $\\log_2(4)$, and the final one has $\\log_2(2)$.  Adding all these up\n",
    "sums to $\\log_2(9)$. Thus, whether or not the heavier ball is isolated in the\n",
    "first weighing, the strategy consumes $\\log_2(9)$ bits, as it must, to find the\n",
    "heavy ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- dom:FIGURE: [fig-probability/NineBall_02.jpg, width=500 frac=0.75] For this strategy, the balls are broken up into three groups of equal size and subsequently weighed.  <div id=\"fig:Information_Entropy_002\"></div> -->\n",

    "However, this is not the only strategy. [Figure](#fig:Information_Entropy_002)\n",
    "shows another.  In this approach, the nine balls are split up into three groups\n",
    "of three balls apiece. Two groups are weighed. If they are of equal weight,\n",
    "then this means the heavier ball is in the group that was left out (dashed\n",
    "arrow). Then, this group is split into two groups, with one element left out.\n",
    "If the two balls on the scale weigh the same, then it means the excluded one is\n",
    "the heavy one. Otherwise, it is one of the balls on the scale. The same process\n",
    "follows if one of the initially weighed groups is heavier (black upward-facing\n",
    "arrow) or lighter (gray lower-facing arrow). As before the information content\n",
    "of the situation is $\\log_2(9)$. The first weighing reduces the uncertainty of\n",
    "the situation by $\\log_2(3)$ and the subsequent weighing reduces it by another\n",
    "$\\log_2(3)$.  As before, these sum to $\\log_2(9)$, but here we only need two\n",
    "weighings whereas the first strategy in [Figure](#fig:Information_Entropy_001) takes\n",
    "an average of $1/9 + 3*8/9 \\approx 2.78$ weighings, which is more than two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does the second strategy use fewer weighings?  To reduce weighings, we need\n",
    "each weighing to adjudicate equally probable situations as many times as\n",
    "possible. Choosing one of the nine balls at the outset (i.e, first strategy in\n",
    "[Figure](#fig:Information_Entropy_001)) does not do this because the\n",
    "probability of selecting the correct ball is $1/9$. This does not create a\n",
    "equiprobable situation in the process. The second strategy leaves an equally\n",
    "probable situation at every stage (see [Figure](#fig:Information_Entropy_002)), so it extracts the most information out of\n",
    "each weighing as possible. Thus, the information content tells us how many bits\n",
    "of information have to be resolved using *any* strategy (i.e., $\\log_2(9)$ in\n",
    "this example). It also illuminates how to efficiently remove uncertainty;\n",
