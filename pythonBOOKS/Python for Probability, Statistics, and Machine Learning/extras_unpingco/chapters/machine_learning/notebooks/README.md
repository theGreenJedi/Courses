This directory contains the corresponding IPython/Jupyter notebooks
for the Statistics chapter. At the command line, do the following

  % ipython notebook

or 

  % jupyter notebook

and then your default browser should pop up and you can click on
the individual notebooks and run all the cells. There may be some
duplication in the output but this is for double checking that the
rendered figures match those that were included in the source text.
Due to some limitations in the translation between formats, there may
be some code in the src-statistics directory that may be useful. This
directory contains author drafts that were usually migrated into the
main text. This material may be useful on that basis.

Please open an Issue here

if you have problems or need more information.
