  Gradient Descent in Practice I - Feature Scaling
 </h1>
 <p>
  <strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  We can speed up gradient descent by having each of our input values in roughly the same range. This is because θ will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.
 </p>
 <p>
  The way to prevent this is to modify the ranges of our input variables so that they are all roughly the same. Ideally:
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  −1 ≤ $$x_{(i)}$$ ≤ 1
 </p>
 <p>
  or
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  −0.5 ≤ $$x_{(i)}$$ ≤ 0.5
 </p>
 <p>
  These aren't exact requirements; we are only trying to speed things up. The goal is to get all input variables into roughly one of these ranges, give or take a few.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two techniques to help with this are
  <strong>
   feature scaling
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   mean normalization
  </strong>
  . Feature scaling involves dividing the input values by the range (i.e. the maximum value minus the minimum value) of the input variable, resulting in a new range of just 1. Mean normalization involves subtracting the average value for an input variable from the values for that input variable resulting in a new average value for the input variable of just zero. To implement both of these techniques, adjust your input values as shown in this formula:
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  $$x_i := \dfrac{x_i - \mu_i}{s_i}$$
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  Where $$μ_i$$ is the
  <strong>
   average
  </strong>
  of all the values for feature (i) and $$s_i$$ is the range of values (max - min), or $$s_i$$ is the standard deviation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note that dividing by the range, or dividing by the standard deviation, give different results. The quizzes in this course use range - the programming exercises use standard deviation.
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  For example, if $$x_i$$ represents housing prices with a range of 100 to 2000  and a mean value of 1000, then, $$x_i := \dfrac{price-1000}{1900}$$.
