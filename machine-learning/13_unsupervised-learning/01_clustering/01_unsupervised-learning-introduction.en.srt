1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,430
In this video, I'd like to
start to talk about clustering.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,670
This will be exciting, because this is our
first unsupervised learning algorithm,

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,880
where we learn from unlabeled
data instead from labelled data.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,450
So, what is unsupervised learning?

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,380
I briefly talked about unsupervised
learning at the beginning of the class but

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,720
it's useful to contrast it
with supervised learning.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,590
So, here's a typical supervised
learning problem where we're given

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,440
a labeled training set and the goal is to
find the decision boundary that separates

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,090
the positive label examples and
the negative label examples.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,190
So, the supervised learning problem in
this case is given a set of labels to fit

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,210
a hypothesis to it.

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,270
In contrast,
in the unsupervised learning problem

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,740
we're given data that does not have
any labels associated with it.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,803
So, we're given data that looks like this.

15
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:53,802
Here's a set of points add in no labels,
and so, our training set is

16
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:59,090
written just x1, x2, and so on up to
x m and we don't get any labels y.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,560
And that's why the points plotted up on
the figure don't have any labels with

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,170
them.

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,810
So, in unsupervised learning what
we do is we give this sort of

20
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,280
unlabeled training set to an algorithm and

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,450
we just ask the algorithm find
some structure in the data for us.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,910
Given this data set one type of structure
we might have an algorithm find is that it

23
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:25,510
looks like this data set has points
grouped into two separate clusters and

24
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,250
so an algorithm that finds

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,480
clusters like the ones I've just circled
is called a clustering algorithm.

26
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,280
And this would be our first
type of unsupervised learning,

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,960
although there will be other types of
unsupervised learning algorithms that

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,750
we'll talk about later that finds
other types of structure or

29
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,920
other types of patterns in
the data other than clusters.

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,060
We'll talk about this after
we've talked about clustering.

31
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,460
So, what is clustering good for?

32
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,010
Early in this class I already
mentioned a few applications.

33
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,535
One is market segmentation where you
may have a database of customers and

34
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,245
want to group them into
different marker segments so

35
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:05,980
you can sell to them separately or serve
your different market segments better.

36
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,594
Social network analysis.

37
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:12,635
There are actually groups have
done this things like looking at

38
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:15,155
a group of people's social networks.

39
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:17,985
So, things like Facebook,
Google+, or maybe information

40
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:21,915
about who other people that you email
the most frequently and who are the people

41
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:25,920
that they email the most frequently and
to find coherence in groups of people.

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,123
So, this would be another maybe clustering
algorithm where you know want to find who

43
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:33,039
are the coherent groups of
friends in the social network?

44
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,340
Here's something that one of my friends
actually worked on which is, use

45
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,970
clustering to organize computer clusters
or to organize data centers better.

46
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,672
Because if you know which computers in the
data center in the cluster tend to work

47
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:48,251
together, you can use that to
reorganize your resources and

48
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,979
how you layout the network and how you
design your data center communications.

49
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:57,433
And lastly, something that actually
another friend worked on using

50
00:02:57,433 --> 00:03:01,272
clustering algorithms to
understand galaxy formation and

51
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:04,280
using that to understand
astronomical data.

52
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,188
So, that's clustering which is our
first example of an unsupervised

53
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:12,629
learning algorithm.

54
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,660
In the next video we'll start to talk
about a specific clustering algorithm.
