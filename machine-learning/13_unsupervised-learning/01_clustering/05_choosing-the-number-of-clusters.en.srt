00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,390
In this video I'd like to

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,780
talk about one last detail

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,950
of K-means clustering which is

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,680
how to choose the number of

5
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,890
clusters, or how to choose

6
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,160
the value of the parameter

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,310
capsule K. To be

8
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,690
honest, there actually isn't a

9
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,420
great way of answering this

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,150
or doing this automatically and

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,930
by far the most common way

12
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,380
of choosing the number of clusters,

13
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,040
is still choosing it manually

14
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,380
by looking at visualizations or by

15
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,070
looking at the output of the clustering algorithm or something else.

16
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,270
But I do get asked

17
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,460
this question quite a lot of

18
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,510
how do you choose the number of

19
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,930
clusters, and so I just want

20
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,650
to tell you know what

21
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,020
are peoples' current thinking on

22
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,480
it although, the most

23
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,060
common thing is actually to

24
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,130
choose the number of clusters by hand.

25
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,680
A large part of

26
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,020
why it might not always

27
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,530
be easy to choose the

28
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,940
number of clusters is that

29
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,920
it is often generally ambiguous how many clusters there are in the data.

30
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,890
Looking at this data set

31
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,110
some of you may see

32
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,830
four clusters and that

33
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,440
would suggest using K equals 4.

34
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,650
Or some of you may

35
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,620
see two clusters and

36
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,460
that will suggest K equals

37
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,630
2 and now this may see three clusters.

38
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,710
And so, looking at the

39
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,750
data set like this, the

40
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,390
true number of clusters, it actually

41
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,560
seems genuinely ambiguous to me,

42
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,160
and I don't think there is one right answer.

43
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,500
And this is part of our supervised learning.

44
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,450
We are aren't given labels, and

45
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,950
so there isn't always a clear cut answer.

46
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,730
And this is one of the

47
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:26,710
things that makes it more difficult

48
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,530
to say, have an automatic

49
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,860
algorithm for choosing how many clusters to have.

50
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,250
When people talk about ways of

51
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,270
choosing the number of clusters,

52
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,050
one method that people sometimes

53
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,150
talk about is something called the Elbow Method.

54
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,490
Let me just tell you a little bit about that,

55
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,760
and then mention some of its advantages but also shortcomings.

56
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,980
So the Elbow Method,

57
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,570
what we're going to do is vary

58
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,860
K, which is the total number of clusters.

59
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,570
So, we're going to run K-means

60
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,340
with one cluster, that means really,

61
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,840
everything gets grouped into a

62
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,530
single cluster and compute the

63
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,850
cost function or compute the distortion

64
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,490
J and plot that here.

65
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,090
And then we're going to run K

66
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,270
means with two clusters, maybe

67
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,430
with multiple random initial agents, maybe not.

68
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,150
But then, you know,

69
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
with two clusters we should

70
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,510
get, hopefully, a smaller distortion,

71
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,820
and so plot that there.

72
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,100
And then run K-means with three

73
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,590
clusters, hopefully, you get even

74
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,680
smaller distortion and plot that there.

75
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,710
I'm gonna run K-means with four, five and so on.

76
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,790
And so we end up with

77
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,840
a curve showing how the

78
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,560
distortion, you know, goes

79
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,170
down as we increase the number of clusters.

80
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,870
And so we get a curve that maybe looks like this.

81
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,210
And if you look at this

82
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,400
curve, what the Elbow Method does

83
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,770
it says "Well, let's look at this plot.

84
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,340
Looks like there's a clear elbow there".

85
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,620
Right, this is, would be by

86
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,210
analogy to the human arm where,

87
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,620
you know, if you imagine that

88
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,460
you reach out your arm,

89
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,940
then, this is your

90
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,340
shoulder joint, this is your

91
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,960
elbow joint and I guess, your hand is at the end over here.

92
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,170
And so this is the Elbow Method.

93
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,930
Then you find this sort of pattern

94
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,630
where the distortion goes down rapidly

95
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,120
from 1 to 2, and 2 to

96
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,330
3, and then you reach an

97
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,160
elbow at 3, and then

98
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,260
the distortion goes down very slowly after that.

99
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,520
And then it looks like, you

100
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,700
know what, maybe using three

101
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,920
clusters is the right

102
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,340
number of clusters, because that's

103
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,430
the elbow of this curve, right?

104
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,040
That it goes down, distortion goes

105
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,290
down rapidly until K equals

106
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,700
3, really goes down very slowly after that.

107
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,850
So let's pick K equals 3.

108
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,570
If you apply the Elbow Method,

109
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,240
and if you get a plot

110
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,450
that actually looks like this,

111
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,120
then, that's pretty good, and

112
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,160
this would be a reasonable way

113
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,590
of choosing the number of clusters.

114
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,600
It turns out the Elbow Method

115
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,170
isn't used that often, and one

116
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,270
reason is that, if you

117
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,470
actually use this on

118
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,060
a clustering problem, it turns out that

119
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,640
fairly often, you know,

120
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,610
you end up with a curve

121
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,940
that looks much more ambiguous, maybe something like this.

122
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,370
And if you look at this,

123
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,220
I don't know, maybe there's

124
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,580
no clear elbow, but it

125
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,090
looks like distortion continuously goes down,

126
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,570
maybe 3 is a

127
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,680
good number, maybe 4 is

128
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,180
a good number, maybe 5 is also not bad.

129
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,190
And so, if you actually

130
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,710
do this in a practice, you know,

131
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,690
if your plot looks like the one on the left and that's great.

132
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,990
It gives you a clear answer, but

133
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,550
just as often, you end

134
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,580
up with a plot that looks

135
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,020
like the one on the right and

136
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,000
is not clear where the

137
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,230
ready location of the elbow

138
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,440
is. It  makes it harder to

139
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,700
choose a number of clusters using this method.

140
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,220
So maybe the quick summary

141
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,500
of the Elbow Method is that is worth the shot

142
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,350
but I wouldn't necessarily,

143
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,700
you know, have a very high

144
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,360
expectation of it working for any particular problem.

145
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,030
Finally, here's one other way

146
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,850
of how, thinking about how

147
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,980
you choose the value of K,

148
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,030
very often people are running

149
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,380
K-means in order you

150
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,770
get clusters for some later

151
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,880
purpose, or for some sort of downstream purpose.

152
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,900
Maybe you want to use K-means

153
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,460
in order to do market segmentation,

154
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,600
like in the T-shirt sizing example that we talked about.

155
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,570
Maybe you want K-means to organize

156
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,300
a computer cluster better, or

157
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,430
maybe a learning cluster for some

158
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,070
different purpose, and so,

159
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,020
if that later, downstream purpose,

160
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,050
such as market segmentation. If

161
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,420
that gives you an evaluation metric,

162
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,670
then often, a better

163
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,890
way to determine the number of

164
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,680
clusters, is to see

165
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,740
how well different numbers of

166
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,140
clusters serve that later downstream purpose.

167
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,050
Let me step through a specific example.

168
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,080
Let me go through the T-shirt

169
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,420
size example again, and I'm

170
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,700
trying to decide, do I want three T-shirt sizes?

171
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,320
So, I choose K equals 3, then

172
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,360
I might have small, medium and large T-shirts.

173
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,250
Or maybe, I want to choose

174
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,240
K equals 5, and then I

175
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,140
might have, you know, extra

176
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,130
small, small, medium, large

177
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,070
and extra large T-shirt sizes.

178
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,580
So, you can have like 3 T-shirt sizes or four or five T-shirt sizes.

179
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,100
We could also have four T-shirt

180
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,740
sizes, but I'm just

181
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,240
showing three and five here,

182
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,670
just to simplify this slide for now.

183
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,020
So, if I run K-means with

184
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,290
K equals 3, maybe I end

185
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,860
up with, that's my small

186
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,020
and that's my

187
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,720
medium and that's my large.

188
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,370
Whereas, if I run K-means with

189
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,540
5 clusters, maybe I

190
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,170
end up with, those are

191
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,400
my extra small T-shirts, these

192
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,920
are my small, these are

193
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,740
my medium, these are my

194
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,110
large and these are my extra large.

195
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,150
And the nice thing about this

196
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,510
example is that, this then

197
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,940
maybe gives us another way

198
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,730
to choose whether we want

199
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,070
3 or 4 or 5 clusters,

200
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,630
and in particular, what you can

201
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,630
do is, you know, think

202
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,770
about this from the perspective

203
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,810
of the T-shirt business and

204
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,150
ask: "Well if I have

205
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,190
five segments, then how well

206
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,610
will my T-shirts fit my

207
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,100
customers and so, how many T-shirts can I sell?

208
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,390
How happy will my customers be?"

209
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,920
What really makes sense, from the

210
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,530
perspective of the T-shirt business,

211
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,390
in terms of whether, I

212
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,480
want to have Goer T-shirt sizes

213
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,040
so that my T-shirts fit my customers better.

214
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,130
Or do I want to have fewer

215
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,570
T-shirt sizes so that

216
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,220
I make fewer sizes of T-shirts.

217
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,290
And I can sell them to the customers more cheaply.

218
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,700
And so, the t-shirt selling

219
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,150
business, that might give you

220
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,260
a way to decide, between three clusters versus five clusters.

221
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,000
So, that gives you an

222
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,880
example of how a

223
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,810
later downstream purpose like

224
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,260
the problem of deciding what

225
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,230
T-shirts to manufacture, how that

226
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,980
can give you an evaluation metric for choosing the number of clusters.

227
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,800
For those of you that are

228
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,490
doing the program exercises, if

229
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,070
you look at this week's

230
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,540
program exercise associative K-means, that's

231
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,000
an example there of using K-means for image compression.

232
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,960
And so if you were trying to

233
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,170
choose how many clusters

234
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,950
to use for that problem, you could

235
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,550
also, again use the

236
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,330
evaluation metric of image compression

237
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,470
to choose the number of clusters, K?

238
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,870
So, how good do you want the

239
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,430
image to look versus, how much

240
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
do you want to compress the file

241
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,390
size of the image, and,

242
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,830
you know, if you do the

243
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:50,980
programming exercise, what I've just

244
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,480
said will make more sense at that time.

245
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,500
So, just summarize, for the

246
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,800
most part, the number of

247
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,560
customers K is still chosen

248
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,900
by hand by human input or human insight.

249
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,810
One way to try to

250
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,010
do so is to use

251
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,360
the Elbow Method, but I

252
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,660
wouldn't always expect that to

253
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,620
work well, but I think

254
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,730
the better way to think about

255
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,800
how to choose the number of

256
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,310
clusters is to ask, for

257
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,890
what purpose are you running K-means?

258
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,610
And then to think, what is

259
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,210
the number of clusters K that

260
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,490
serves that, you know, whatever

261
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,710
later purpose that you actually run the K-means for.
