1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,950
In this video, I'd like to show you
a fun and historically important example

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,820
of neural networks learning of using
a neural network for autonomous driving.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,740
That is getting a car to
learn to drive itself.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,850
The video that I'll showed a minute
was something that I'd gotten from

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,030
Dean Pomerleau, who was a colleague who
works out in Carnegie Mellon University

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,460
out on the east coast
of the United States.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,910
And in part of the video you
see visualizations like this.

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,609
And I want to tell what a visualization
looks like before starting the video.

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,840
Down here on the lower left is the view
seen by the car of what's in front of it.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,980
And so here you kinda see a road that's
maybe going a bit to the left, and

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,190
then going a little bit to the right.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,240
And up here on top,

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,780
this first horizontal bar shows the
direction selected by the human driver.

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,525
And this location of this bright white
band that shows the steering direction

15
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:02,270
selected by the human driver where you
know here far to the left corresponds to

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,577
steering hard left, here corresponds
to steering hard to the right.

17
00:01:06,577 --> 00:01:11,285
And so this location which is a little bit
to the left, a little bit left of center

18
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:15,808
means that the human driver at this
point was steering slightly to the left.

19
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:19,789
And this second bot here corresponds
to the steering direction selected by

20
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,242
the learning algorithm and

21
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:25,349
again the location of this sort of white
band means that the neural network was

22
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,240
here selecting a steering direction
that's slightly to the left.

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,920
And in fact before the neural
network starts leaning initially,

24
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,451
you see that the network outputs
a grey band, like a grey,

25
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:41,480
like a uniform grey band throughout this
region and sort of a uniform gray fuzz

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,520
corresponds to the neural network
having been randomly initialized.

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,650
And initially having no
idea how to drive the car.

28
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,510
Or initially having no idea of
what direction to steer in.

29
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,050
And is only after it has learned for

30
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,850
a while, that will then start to output
like a solid white band in just a small

31
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,990
part of the region corresponding to
choosing a particular steering direction.

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,840
And that corresponds to when the neural
network becomes more confident

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,230
in selecting a band in
one particular location,

34
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,160
rather than outputting a sort of light
gray fuzz, but instead outputting

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,822
a white band that's more constantly
selecting one's steering direction.

36
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:24,170
>> ALVINN is a system of
artificial neural networks

37
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,044
that learns to steer by
watching a person drive.

38
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:30,337
ALVINN is designed to
control the NAVLAB 2,

39
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:34,497
a modified Army Humvee who
had put sensors, computers,

40
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:38,670
and actuators for
autonomous navigation experiments.

41
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,030
The initial step in configuring ALVINN
is creating a network just here.

42
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,785
During training, a person drives
the vehicle while ALVINN watches.

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,872
Once every two seconds, ALVINN digitizes
a video image of the road ahead, and

44
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:03,750
records the person's steering direction.

45
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:16,955
This training image is reduced in
resolution to 30 by 32 pixels and

46
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:21,542
provided as input to ALVINN's
three layered network.

47
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:26,431
Using the back propagation learning
algorithm,ALVINN is training to output

48
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:30,440
the same steering direction as
the human driver for that image.

49
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,349
Initially the network
steering response is random.

50
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:48,366
After about two minutes of training
the network learns to accurately imitate

51
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:51,124
the steering reactions
of the human driver.

52
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:06,940
This same training procedure is
repeated for other road types.

53
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,018
After the networks have been trained
the operator pushes the run switch and

54
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:15,500
ALVINN begins driving.

55
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:23,657
Twelve times per second,
ALVINN digitizes the image and

56
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:25,740
feeds it to its neural networks.

57
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:39,899
Each network, running in parallel,
produces a steering direction,

58
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:44,988
and a measure of its'
confidence in its' response.

59
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:52,372
The steering direction,
from the most confident network,

60
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:57,140
in this network training for the one lane
road, is used to control the vehicle.

61
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:10,549
Suddenly an intersection
appears ahead of the vehicle.

62
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:27,422
As the vehicle approaches the intersection
the confidence of the lone lane network

63
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:28,169
decreases.

64
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:42,539
As it crosses the intersection and
the two lane road ahead comes into view,

65
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,448
the confidence of the two
lane network rises.

66
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:55,860
When its' confidence rises the two
lane network is selected to steer.

67
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,240
Safely guiding the vehicle into
its lane onto the two lane road.

68
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,100
>> So that was autonomous driving
using the neural network.

69
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,270
Of course there are more recently more
modern attempts to do autonomous driving.

70
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,680
There are few projects in the US and
Europe and so

71
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,050
on, that are giving more robust
driving controllers than this, but

72
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,790
I think it's still pretty remarkable and
pretty amazing how instant neural network

73
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,230
trained with backpropagation can actually
learn to drive a car somewhat well.
