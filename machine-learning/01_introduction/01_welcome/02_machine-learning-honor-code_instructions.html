  Machine Learning Honor Code
 </h1>
 <p>
  We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including
  <strong>
   in-video questions
  </strong>
  ). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the
  <strong>
   review questions
  </strong>
  should be your own work. For the
  <strong>
   programming exercises
  </strong>
  , you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students.

  Scenario 1: Code to delete
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Learner Question/Comment: "Here is the code I have so far, but it fails the grader. Please help me fix it."
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why Delete?
  </strong>
  : The reason is that if there is a simple fix provided by a student, a quick copy and paste with a small edit will provide credit without individual effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Learner Question: A student substitutes words for the math operators, but includes the variable names (or substitutes the equivalent greek letters (θ for 'theta', etc). This student also provides a sentence-by-sentence, line by line, description of exactly what their code implements. "The first line of my script has the equation "hypothesis equals theta times X", but I get the following error message...".
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why Delete?:
  </strong>
  This should be deleted. “Spelling out” the code in English is the same as using the regular code.
 </p>
 <h3 level="3">
  Scenario 2: Code not to delete
 </h3>
 <p>
  Learner Question: How do I subset a matrix to eliminate the intercept?
 </p>
 <p>
  Mentor Response:  This probably would be okay, especially if the person posting makes an effort to not use familiar variable names, or to use a context which has nothing to do with the contexts in the assignments.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is clearly ok to show examples of Octave code to demonstrate a technique. Even if the technique itself is directly applicable to a programming problem at hand. As long as what is typed cannot be "cut and pasted" into the program at hand.
 </p>
 <p>
  E.g. how do I set column 1 of a matrix to zero? Try this in your Octave work area:
 </p>
 <p>
  &gt;&gt; A = magic(3)
 </p>
 <p>
  &gt;&gt; A(:,1) = 0
 </p>
 <p>
  The above is always acceptable (in my understanding). Demonstrating techniques and learning the language/syntax are important Forum activities.
