  What is Machine Learning?
 </h2>
 <p>
  Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
 </p>
 <p>
  Example: playing checkers.
 </p>
 <p>
  E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
 </p>
 <p>
  T = the task of playing checkers.
 </p>
 <p>
  P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
 </p>
 <p>
  In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
 </p>
 <p>
  Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
