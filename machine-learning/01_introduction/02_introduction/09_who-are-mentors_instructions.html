   Mentor Program Overview:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Community Mentors are successful, dedicated Coursera learners who volunteer to assist with support and discussion forum moderation in courses that they have already completed. They have been recruited by Coursera to encourage newer learners, answer questions, set an example by posting thoughtful and timely content, and report platform bugs and inappropriate content to Coursera.

The mentors are not employed by Stanford University and they have not been vetted by Stanford University as experts on course content or course facilitation.
