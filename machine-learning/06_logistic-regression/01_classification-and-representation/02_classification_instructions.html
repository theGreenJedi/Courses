  Classification
 </h1>
 <p>
  To attempt classification, one method is to use linear regression and map all predictions greater than 0.5 as a 1 and all less than 0.5 as a 0. However, this method doesn't work well because classification is not actually a linear function.
 </p>
 <p hasmath="true">
  The classification problem is just like the regression
problem, except that the values we now want to predict take on only
a small number of discrete values. For now, we will focus on the
  <strong>
   binary
classification
  </strong>
  <strong>
   problem
  </strong>
  in which y can take on only two values, 0 and 1.
(Most of what we say here will also generalize to the multiple-class case.)
For instance, if we are trying to build a spam classifier for email, then $$x^{(i)}$$ may be some features of a piece of email, and y may be 1 if it is a piece
of spam mail, and 0 otherwise. Hence, y∈{0,1}. 0 is also called the negative class, and 1
the positive class, and they are sometimes also denoted by the symbols “-”
and “+.” Given $$x^{(i)}$$, the corresponding $$y^{(i)}$$ is also called the label for the
training example.
