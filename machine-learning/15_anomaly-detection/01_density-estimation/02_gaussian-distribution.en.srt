1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,540
In this video, I'd like to talk about
the Gaussian distribution which is also

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,440
called the normal distribution.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,417
In case you're already intimately
familiar with the Gaussian distribution,

4
00:00:11,417 --> 00:00:14,678
it's probably okay to skip this video,
but if you're not sure or

5
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:18,475
if it has been a while since you've
worked with the Gaussian distribution or

6
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:22,950
normal distribution then please do watch
this video all the way to the end.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,970
And in the video after this we'll start
applying the Gaussian distribution

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,250
to developing an anomaly
detection algorithm.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,450
Let's say x is a row value's random
variable, so x is a row number.

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,840
If the probability distribution
of x is Gaussian with mean mu and

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,710
variance sigma squared.

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,280
Then, we'll write this as x,
the random variable.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,517
Tilde, this little tilde,
this is distributed as.

14
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:02,278
And then to denote
a Gaussian distribution,

15
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:07,440
sometimes I'm going to write script
N parentheses mu comma sigma script.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,960
So this script N stands for
normal since Gaussian and

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,390
normal they mean the thing are synonyms.

18
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,924
And the Gaussian distribution is
parametarized by two parameters,

19
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:21,581
by a mean parameter which we denote mu and

20
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:26,160
a variance parameter which
we denote via sigma squared.

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,120
If we plot the Gaussian distribution or
Gaussian probability density.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:36,230
It'll look like the bell shaped curve
which you may have seen before.

23
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,870
And so

24
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,300
this bell shaped curve is paramafied
by those two parameters, mu and sequel.

25
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,520
And the location of the center of this
bell shaped curve is the mean mu.

26
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,060
And the width of this bell shaped curve,
roughly that,

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,550
is this parameter, sigma,
is also called one standard deviation,

28
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,820
and so this specifies the probability
of x taking on different values.

29
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,060
So, x taking on values here in
the middle here it's pretty high,

30
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,490
since the Gaussian density here is pretty
high, whereas x taking on values further,

31
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,140
and further away will be
diminishing in probability.

32
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,990
Finally just for completeness
let me write out the formula for

33
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,990
the Gaussian distribution.

34
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,490
So the probability of x, and
I'll sometimes write this as the p (x)

35
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,380
when we write this as P ( x ; mu,
sigma squared), and so this denotes that

36
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,920
the probability of X is parameterized by
the two parameters mu and sigma squared.

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,508
And the formula for
the Gaussian density is this 1/ root 2 pi,

38
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:44,250
sigma e (-(x-mu/g)
squared/2 sigma squared.

39
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,220
So there's no need to
memorize this formula.

40
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,010
This is just the formula for the
bell-shaped curve over here on the left.

41
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,230
There's no need to memorize it,

42
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,490
and if you ever need to use this,
you can always look this up.

43
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,720
And so that figure on the left, that is
what you get if you take a fixed value of

44
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,490
mu and take a fixed value of sigma,
and you plot P(x) so this curve here.

45
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,940
This is really p(x) plotted
as a function of X for

46
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,820
a fixed value of Mu and of sigma squared.

47
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,530
And by the way sometimes it's easier to
think in terms of sigma squared that's

48
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,940
called the variance.

49
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,880
And sometimes is easier to
think in terms of sigma.

50
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,040
So sigma is called the standard deviation,
and

51
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,374
so it specifies the width of this
Gaussian probability density,

52
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:35,630
where as the square sigma, or
sigma squared, is called the variance.

53
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,070
Let's look at some examples of what
the Gaussian distribution looks like.

54
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,660
If mu equals zero, sigma equals one.

55
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,410
Then we have a Gaussian distribution
that's centered around zero,

56
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,940
because that's mu and

57
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,880
the width of this Gaussian, so that's one
standard deviation is sigma over there.

58
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,330
Let's look at some examples of Gaussians.

59
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,900
If mu is equal to zero and
sigma equals one,

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,380
then that corresponds to a Gaussian
distribution that is centered at zero,

61
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,920
since mu is zero, and
the width of this Gaussian

62
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,880
is is controlled by sigma by
that variance parameter sigma.

63
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,830
Here's another example.

64
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,690
That same mu is equal to 0 and
sigma is equal to .5 so

65
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,740
the standard deviation is .5 and the
variance sigma squared would therefore be

66
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,970
the square of 0.5 would be 0.25 and
in that case the Gaussian distribution,

67
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,599
the Gaussian probability
density goes like this.

68
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,430
Is also sent as zero.

69
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,160
But now the width of this is much
smaller because the smaller the area is,

70
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,600
the width of this Gaussian
density is roughly half as wide.

71
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,490
But because this is a probability
distribution, the area under the curve,

72
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,550
that's the shaded area there.

73
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,770
That area must integrate to one this is
a property of probability distributing.

74
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,220
So this is a much taller Gaussian
density because this half is Y but

75
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,140
half the standard deviation but
it twice as tall.

76
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,060
Another example is sigma is equal to
2 then you get a much fatter a much

77
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,300
wider Gaussian density and so

78
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,920
here the sigma parameter controls that
Gaussian distribution has a wider width.

79
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,240
And once again, the area under the curve,
that is the shaded area, will always

80
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,580
integrate to one, that's the property of
probability distributions and because it's

81
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,220
wider it's also half as tall in order
to still integrate to the same thing.

82
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,340
And finally one last example would be if
we now change the mu parameters as well.

83
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,090
Then instead of being centered at 0 we
now have a Gaussian distribution that's

84
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:50,150
centered at 3 because this shifts over
the entire Gaussian distribution.

85
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,100
Next, let's talk about
the Parameter estimation problem.

86
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,560
So what's the parameter
estimation problem?

87
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,014
Let's say we have a dataset of
m examples so exponents x m and

88
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:04,210
lets say each of this
example is a row number.

89
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,214
Here in the figure I've plotted
an example of the dataset so

90
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:11,117
the horizontal axis is the x axis and
either will have a range of examples of x,

91
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:14,580
and I've just plotted
them on this figure here.

92
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,290
And the parameter estimation problem is,

93
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,150
let's say I suspect that these examples
came from a Gaussian distribution.

94
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,340
So let's say I suspect that each of
my examples, x i, was distributed.

95
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,640
That's what this tilde thing means.

96
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,050
Let's not suspect that each of these
examples were distributed according to

97
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,400
a normal distribution, or Gaussian
distribution, with some parameter mu and

98
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,590
some parameter sigma square.

99
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,840
But I don't know what the values
of these parameters are.

100
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,990
The problem of parameter estimation is,
given my data set, I want to try to

101
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,678
figure out, well I want to estimate what
are the values of mu and sigma squared.

102
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:51,620
So if you're given a data set like this,

103
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:58,070
it looks like maybe if I estimate what
Gaussian distribution the data came from,

104
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,440
maybe that might be roughly
the Gaussian distribution it came from.

105
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,000
With mu being the center of
the distribution, sigma standing for

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,510
the deviation controlling the width
of this Gaussian distribution.

107
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,500
Seems like a reasonable fit to the data.

108
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,970
Because, you know, looks like the data
has a very high probability of

109
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,870
being in the central region, and
a low probability of being further out,

110
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,060
even though probability of
being further out, and so on.

111
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,470
So maybe this is a reasonable
estimate of mu and sigma squared.

112
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,510
That is, if it corresponds to
a Gaussian distribution function

113
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,280
that looks like this.

114
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,010
So what I'm going to do is just write out
the formula the standard formulas for

115
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,160
estimating the parameters Mu and
sigma squared.

116
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,890
Our estimate or
the way we're going to estimate mu

117
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,190
is going to be just
the average of my example.

118
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,770
So mu is the mean parameter.

119
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,220
Just take my training set,
take my m examples and average them.

120
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,710
And that just means the center
of this distribution.

121
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,060
How about sigma squared?

122
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,320
Well, the variance, I'll just write
out the standard formula again,

123
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:12,260
I'm going to estimate as sum over one
through m of x i minus mu squared.

124
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,370
And so this mu here is actually
the mu that I compute over here using

125
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,780
this formula.

126
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,060
And what the variance is, or

127
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,130
one interpretation of the variance
is that if you look at this term,

128
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:26,260
that's the square difference between the
value I got in my example minus the mean.

129
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,890
Minus the center,
minus the mean of the distribution.

130
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,730
And so
in the variance I'm gonna estimate as

131
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,160
just the average of the square differences
between my examples, minus the mean.

132
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,450
And as a side comment, only for those
of you that are experts in statistics.

133
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,660
If you're an expert in statistics,
and if you've heard of

134
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,800
maximum likelihood estimation,
then these parameters, these estimates,

135
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,320
are actually the maximum likelihood
estimates of the primes of mu and

136
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,480
sigma squared but if you haven't heard
of that before don't worry about it,

137
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,360
all you need to know is that these
are the two standard formulas for

138
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,090
how to figure out what are mu and
Sigma squared given the data set.

139
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,210
Finally one last side comment again only
for those of you that have maybe taken

140
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,240
the statistics class before but if you've
taken statistics This class before.

141
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,581
Some of you may have seen the formula
here where this is M-1 instead of M so

142
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:22,480
this first term becomes
1/M-1 instead of 1/M.

143
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,698
In machine learning people tend to learn
1/M formula but in practice whether it is

144
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:33,100
1/M or 1/M-1 it makes essentially no
difference assuming M is reasonably large.

145
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,340
a reasonably large training set size.

146
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,360
So just in case you've seen
this other version before.

147
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,240
In either version it works just about
equally well but in machine learning

148
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,770
most people tend to use 1/M in this
formula.And the two versions have

149
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,440
slightly different theoretical properties
like these are different math properties.

150
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,361
Bit of practice it really makes makes
very little difference, if any.

151
00:09:56,486 --> 00:10:01,264
So, hopefully you now have a good sense of
what the Gaussian distribution looks like,

152
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:03,817
as well as how to estimate
the parameters mu and

153
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:07,875
sigma squared of Gaussian distribution
if you're given a training set,

154
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,932
that is if you're given a set of data
that you suspect comes from a Gaussian

155
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:16,260
distribution with unknown parameters,
mu and sigma squared.

156
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,723
In the next video,
we'll start to take this and

157
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:21,507
apply it to develop an anomaly
detection algorithm.
