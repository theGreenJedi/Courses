# MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

## A new and updated introduction to computer science as a tool to solve real-world analytical problems using Python 3.5.

About this course

This course is the first of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and 
Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to 
computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people 
taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be 
their first and last computer science courses. This run features updated lecture videos, lecture exercises, and problem sets to 
use the new version of Python 3.5. Even if you took the course with Python 2.7, you will be able to easily transition to 
Python 3.5 in future courses, or enroll now to refresh your learning.

Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth
rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is 
possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are 
not "computation appreciation" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and 
effort learning to bend the computer to their will.

What you'll learn

    A Notion of computation
    The Python programming language
    Some simple algorithms
    Testing and debugging
    An informal introduction to algorithmic complexity
    Data structures

### Documentation

    [Official Python 3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html - "official"/technical explanation of what a particular function/operator does, examples of correct syntax, what the various libraries are, etc.

### Textbooks/Tutorials

    Dive Into Python - another survey of Python syntax, datatypes, etc.
    Think Python by Allen Downey - a good general overview of the Python language. Includes exercises.
    The Official Python Tutorial - self-explanatory
    Learn Python the Hard Way - (note: for Python 2) another free online text
    Reserved Keywords in Python - don't use these as variable names
    PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code - learn what is good and bad style in Python
    CheckIO - learn Python by exploring a game world
    Invent with Python - develop your Python skills by making games or hacking ciphers
    Codecademy - (note: for Python 2) learn Python by building web apps and manipulating data; interactive tutorial sequence
    Python Tutor - interactive tutorial sequence of exercises

### Debugging

    Python Tutor - an excellent way to actually visualize how the interpreter actually reads and executes your code
    DiffChecker - compares two sets of text and shows you which lines are different
    Debugging in Python - steps you can take to try to debug your program

### Software

    Python Tools for Visual Studio - Visual Studio plug-in enabling Python programming

### Other Q&A

    Stack Overflow - a large Q&A forum for programming concepts (not just Python). Try searching here before you post on the edX forum, and you may find that someone has already answered your question.

### More practice problems

    Python Challenge - a series of puzzles you can try to test your Python abilities
    Project Euler - additional programming challenges you can try once your Python knowledge becomes stronger; problems are sorted by increasing difficulty
    Coding Bat - problems you can solve within an online interpreter
    Codewars - improve your skills by training on real code challenges
