# MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

## A new and updated introduction to computer science as a tool to solve real-world analytical problems using Python 3.5.

About this course

This course is the first of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and 
Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to 
computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people 
taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be 
their first and last computer science courses. This run features updated lecture videos, lecture exercises, and problem sets to 
use the new version of Python 3.5. Even if you took the course with Python 2.7, you will be able to easily transition to 
Python 3.5 in future courses, or enroll now to refresh your learning.

Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth
rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is 
possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are 
not "computation appreciation" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and 
effort learning to bend the computer to their will.

What you'll learn

    A Notion of computation
    The Python programming language
    Some simple algorithms
    Testing and debugging
    An informal introduction to algorithmic complexity
    Data structures
