1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,120
As you've seen Python has
a built-in function called help

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,020
that will show you information
about the function.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,880
IDLE will also provide
information when you start to

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,790
type the call on that function.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,830
For example, when you call function
help on the absolute value function,

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,689
you get a nice description
of what it does.

7
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:24,045
Also, when you start to write a call on
that function, it pops a little yellow box

8
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:28,900
in IDLE showing you the type of
the parameters and the returned type.

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,125
You can provide the same kind of
information for your own functions by

10
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:36,540
writing documentation in a particular
format called a doc strength.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,020
We have written documentation for

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,970
the area of a triangle function
that we wrote last week.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,520
Notice that we are using
a triple coded string

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,810
because our descriptions
spends multiple lines.

15
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,890
We will now run this module in order to
have area available to us in the Python

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,160
shell and when I ask for

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,210
help on area, we now see what
we have inside the doc string.

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,940
Furthermore, this first line of
the doc string is what will show up

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,980
when I start to type a call on area.

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,400
From now on, we will always provide
doc strings for our functions

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,250
both to describe what they do and
also to hook into Python's help system.
