		<h3>
			Computer Memory
		</h3>
		<p>
			For the purpose of this course, you may think of <em>computer memory</em> as a long list of storage locations where each location is identified with a unique number and each location houses a value. This unique number is called a <em>memory address</em>. Typically, we will write memory addresses as a number with an "id" as a prefix to distinguish them from other numbers (for example, <code>id201</code> is memory address 201).
		</p>
		<p>
			Variables are a way to keep track of values stored in computer memory. A <em>variable</em> is a named location in computer memory. Python keeps variables in a separate list from values. A variable will contain a memory address, and that memory address contains the value. The variable then refers to the value. Python will pick the memory addresses for you.

		<h3>
			Terminology
		</h3>
		<p>
			A value has a memory address.<br>
			A variable contains a memory address.<br>
			A variable refers to a value.<br>
			A variable points to a value.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Example: Value <code>8.5</code> has memory address <code>id34</code>.<br>
			Variable <code>shoe_size</code> contains memory address <code>id34</code>.<br>
			The value of <code>shoe_size</code> is <code>8.5</code>.<br>
			<code>shoe_size</code> refers to value <code>8.5</code>.<br>
			<code>shoe_size</code> points to value <code>8.5</code>.<br>
