00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,006
This video shows you how to download
Python and also talks a bit about what a

2
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:08,043
program is.
Programs are everywhere on your computer

3
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:12,033
and on the internet.
Every time you use a web browser, play a

4
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:17,052
computer game or write a text message on
your cell phone, you're using a program.

5
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:22,006
Even your operating system, such as OS10,
Linux or Windows is a program.

6
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:27,000
A program is just a set of instructions.
We say programs are run or executed.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,055
Program, such as your operating system,
run on hardware, like a cell phone, or

8
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:35,032
your laptop, or a tablet.
But programs can also be run by other

9
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:38,042
programs.
This is what happens when you play a game

10
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:42,006
in a web browser.
Your web browser knows how to run programs

11
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:45,028
written in a programming language called
Java script.

12
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:50,005
This webpage on wikipedia lists all the
programming languages that anyone has ever

13
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:53,016
bothered to enter here, and there are
hundreds of them.

14
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:56,055
You've probably heard of some of the
programming languages.

15
00:00:56,055 --> 00:01:01,032
We've heard a lot of them but certainly
nowhere near all of them and we doubt that

16
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:04,054
anybody knows all the programming
languages listed here.

17
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:07,029
So, Python is a programming language, one
of many.

18
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:11,032
In order to learn Python programs, you
need to download a program that

19
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:15,045
understands that language much like your
browser understands Javascript.

20
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:21,042
In order to work through this course, you
will need to download this program from

21
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:24,091
python.org.
There are two main versions of Python,

22
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:29,017
Python two and Python three.
We're going to use Python three.

23
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:34,071
So, go ahead and click on Quick Links, and
this is the download page for Python

24
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:39,054
three, the current version.
If you use Linux, you can use your package

25
00:01:39,054 --> 00:01:44,009
manager to install Python three.
If you use Windows, this link is

26
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,065
appropriate.
If you use OS ten, one of the recent

27
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:52,024
versions, at least, then this is the
appropriate link to click.

28
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:58,049
If you use a Mac, you may need to install
something called TickleTK in order to run

29
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,033
the, the program we use to write python
programs.

30
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:08,035
So, let's just scroll down to the bottom
here, if you're a Mac user click on this

31
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:14,037
link, and then scroll down and download
Active TCLE.5, .12 or whatever the newest

32
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:19,089
version is.
You are going to have to go to the active

33
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:26,076
state website and then just click this big
blue download button in order to get that.

34
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:33,047
To write our Python programs we are going
to use a program called Idle named after

35
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:38,024
Eric Idle of Monty Python it will comes
with Python.

36
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:44,665
Just double click on the icon and
hopefully you see a window that looks like
