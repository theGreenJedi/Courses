Hi, everyone. Welcome to Learn to Program,
the Fundamentals. This course is seven weeks long. And each week, there will be about
one hour of video for you to watch. >> Throughout the course,
there will be homework exercises and programming assignments. These will give you
the opportunity to practice. Practice is key for learning to program,
much like it's important for learning how to play a musical instrument. >> We're excited to be teaching tens of
thousands of people from around the world. There's a course discussion board
which we're going to be using for discussion, instead of email. >> We're really looking forward
to the next seven weeks. Thank you for joining us.
