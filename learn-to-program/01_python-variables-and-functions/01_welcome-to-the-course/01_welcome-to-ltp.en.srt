Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,880
Welcome to Learn to Program,
the Fundamentals.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,480
This course is seven weeks long.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,230
And each week, there will be about
one hour of video for you to watch.

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,620
>> Throughout the course,
there will be homework exercises and

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,220
programming assignments.

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,770
These will give you
the opportunity to practice.

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,780
Practice is key for learning to program,
much like it's important for

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,320
learning how to play a musical instrument.

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,530
>> We're excited to be teaching tens of
thousands of people from around the world.

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,980
There's a course discussion board
which we're going to be using for

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,540
discussion, instead of email.

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,450
>> We're really looking forward
to the next seven weeks.

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,350
Thank you for joining us.
