  Course Overview
 </h2>
 <p>
  Here are the parts of the course:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Seven modules.  The video lectures will take you very roughly 1â€“2 hours per module, including doing in-video quiz questions that pop up as you are learning.  The quizzes are not part of the marking scheme, but will help you remember the material. Some learners have reported that it is helpful to use IDLE (the program we use to write Python programs) while the lectures progress, typing in the Python code that we show.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Seven quizzes, one per module. These are intended to have you practice the material introduced in the lectures, and will usually involve some thought questions and some basic programming exercises.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Three assignments. In these, you will write larger programs than in the quizzes, and their content will integrate all the material seen so far, with a focus on the material covered in the previous two modules.  Expect to spend quite a bit more time on the assignments than on the quizzes. Because the programs you will write are fairly large, the handouts are quite detailed. You should expect to read them more than once in order to fully understand what you are being asked to do.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    A final exam. This will be comprehensive.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  Quiz and Assignment Submission
 </h2>
 <p>
  Quizzes and assignments are graded when you submit them. You can submit each quiz up to 3 times every 8 hours, and we will use the highest grade from all of your submissions. You can submit each assignment as many times as you like up until the due time. Again, we will use the highest grade from all of your submissions.
