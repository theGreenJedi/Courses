			The Built-in Function: range
		</h3>
		<p>
			Python has a built-in function called <code>range</code> that is useful to use when you want to generate a sequence of numbers. You can type <code>help(range)</code> in IDLE if you ever need a reminder. 
		</p>

		<p>The example below will print the integers 0 to 9, inclusive. 
			<pre>
for i in range(10):
    print (i)
			</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
			The form of <code>range</code> is:
			<pre>
range([start,] stop[, step]):
    return a virtual sequence of numbers from start to stop by step
			</pre>
		</p>

		<h3>Applications of Range</h3>
		<p>
			There are other options you can specify to <code>range</code>. One option is to let range generate the numbers corresponding to indices of a string or a list.
		</p>
		<pre>
s = 'computer science'
for i in range(len(s)):
    print(i)
		</pre>

		<p> 
			You can also tell <code>range</code> what index to start at. For instance, the example below starts at index 1 (as opposed to the default which is 0).
		</p>
		<pre>
for i in range(1, len(s)):
	print(i)
		</pre>

		<p>
			You can even specify the "step" for <code>range</code>. The default stepping size is 1, which means that numbers increment by 1. The example below starts at index 1 and its step size is there (goes to every third index). 
		</p>
		<pre>
for i in range(1, len(s), 3):
    print(i)
		</pre>
