1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:06,565
When working with 'if statements' we are
going to have some decisions to make about

2
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:10,499
how to structure our code.
In this lecture, we will examine two

3
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:15,130
problems, and explore alternative
solutions involving 'if' for each of the

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,303
problems.
This example problem involves two grades;

5
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:22,490
grade one, and grade two.
We'll give grade one the value of seventy,

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:28,421
and grade two gets eighty Now, there's an
if' lif statement' on lines four through

7
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:31,723
seven.
There's a Boolean expression associated

8
00:00:31,723 --> 00:00:36,389
with the if, and another Boolean
expression associated with the Lif.

9
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:40,050
These expressions are evaluated from top
to bottom.

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,937
And when one of the expressions is true,
the body associated with it gets executed.

11
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:51,608
And the if statement exits at that point,
without continuing on to evaluate the

12
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:56,201
subsequent expressions.
Because of that, at most one of the two

13
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:59,917
print statements will get executed in this
case.

14
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:05,103
So, let's look at this code.
If the grape one is greater than 50, and

15
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:08,354
it is, we're enter into the body of the
if.

16
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:14,082
And at this point, becaue one of the
expressions associated with the if was

17
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:18,495
true, the if statement will exit after
executing this body.

18
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:24,581
So we jump down to line nine.
In line nine there's another if statement

19
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:27,965
and on line eleven there is a third if
statement.

20
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:33,561
The condition associated with the if on
line nine is the same as the one on line

21
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:39,156
four and the condition associated with the
if on line eleven is the same as that

22
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:44,475
associated with the Lif on line six.
However because this code from lines nine

23
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:49,586
through twelve is two separate if
statements, as opposed to the if Lif that

24
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:54,015
exists on lines four through seven.
It behaves differently.

25
00:01:54,015 --> 00:01:59,299
We first evaluate the expression
associated with if online nine, and it's

26
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:02,557
true.
So, we enter into its body and print the

27
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:05,960
message.
And, at this point we will exit that if

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,000
statement, moving onto the subsequent
code.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,923
And, that code is line eleven, where there
is a separate if statement.

30
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:19,860
This Boolean expression is also true, so
in this case its body is executed as well.

31
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,621
So the if Lif is not equivalent to two if
statements.

32
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:30,100
And we need to take that into account when
we're running our code, and take care to

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,269
use the appropriate structure in each
situation.

34
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:38,023
Let's consider another problem.
This problem involves predicting whether

35
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:43,040
we should bring an umbrella or not.
So we'll take into consideration whether

36
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,606
precipitation is expected using a true or
false value.

37
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:51,623
And what the temperature is for today.
The temperature, in this case is +eight

38
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:55,534
degrees Celsius.
This if statement for it checks the

39
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:59,829
condition to see if precipitation is
expected and that is true.

40
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:05,419
So we enter into the body of the if and in
the body there is actually another if

41
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,691
statement.
One if statement is nested inside the

42
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:11,896
other.
We can then check that boolean condition

43
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:16,600
and find that it is true, so we print the
message bring your umbrella.

44
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,156
I want to modify this code so that we
write a second version without the

45
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:27,303
nesting.
Notice that when precipitation is true,

46
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:33,207
the condition associated with the first
if, and the condition associated with the

47
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:37,873
second if is also true.
That's when we print bring your umbrella.

48
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:42,757
So they both need to be true.
We'll use the Boolean operator "and" to

49
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:47,933
state that, and that was we can structure
this as a single If statement.

50
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:54,274
Let's visualize the execution.
In the first case, the variables have

51
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:58,513
values that, causes to print Bring Your
Umbrella.

52
00:03:58,513 --> 00:04:05,328
And, in the second case, we evaluate this
Boolean condition, precipitation refers to

53
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:11,976
the value TRUE, temperature refers to the
value +eight, so this expression is also

54
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:16,464
true, and the message Bring Your Umbrella
is displayed.

55
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:22,198
Now, let us expand on this example.
I'm going to add an Else to the if

56
00:04:22,198 --> 00:04:27,419
statement on line five.
This else describes the statement to print

57
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:33,962
when temperature is not greater than zero.
I'm going to now edit the code on line ten

58
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:38,657
to make that if statement equivalent to
the one on line four.

59
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:43,583
Let's look at the conditions under which
the Else code executes.

60
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:49,663
The precipitation condition needs to be
true, the temperature greater than zero

61
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:53,820
condition must be false and then the Else
is executed.

62
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:00,587
So we can express this using an L if.
We want to make sure that the first

63
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:05,779
condition is true.
And we don't need to check the second

64
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:10,321
condition.
Because we'll only reach the L if when

65
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:15,513
that is false.
In that case, we'll print the same message

66
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:19,500
as above.
Let's visualize the execution now.

67
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:25,350
In fact there's one more thing to do.
Let's make this a negative three so that

68
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,680
it's below freezing and we print those
messages.

69
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,970
So if precipitation is true, we enter into
the body of the if.

70
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,863
Checking this condition, because I just
changed what temperature refers to, it's

71
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:43,370
false.
And we print the statement from the Else.

72
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,218
In the second If statement, we check the
first condition, which is false because

73
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:55,436
the temperature is not greater than zero.
Now we must check the L if clause and this

74
00:05:55,436 --> 00:06:01,284
condition is true, so we enter into the
body of that L if and we print the same

75
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:04,245
message.
So these two pieces of code are
