1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:06,794
Lists are mutable sequences.
There are immutable sequences as well.

2
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:13,966
These are called tuples.
Here we create a tuple with A3 and -0.2 in

3
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:20,744
it, and we assign it to variable tup.
Tuples and lists use the same index

4
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:24,980
notation.
Here, we look at tuple at index zero,

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:32,323
index one, index two, and also, we can use
negative indices such as tup at index

6
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,487
-one.
Slicing a tuple, produces a tuple.

7
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:41,779
Here, we slice tup up two, but not
including index two and we can also slice

8
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:46,160
tup from index one up to, but not
including index three.

9
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,940
We cannot change the tuples, tuples are
inmutable.

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,326
A sign-in into a tuple produces a type
error, tuple object does not support item

11
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:03,299
assignment.
Lists have methods append, count, extend,

12
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:06,599
index, insert, pop, remove, reverse, and
sort.

13
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,877
But tuples only have count and index.
The other methods in list all modify the

14
00:01:12,877 --> 00:01:18,461
list.
Like lists, we can iterate over the items

15
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:24,540
in a tuple.
Function len, works on tuples.

16
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,280
We can iterate over the indices of a
tuple.

17
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:39,120
To create a tuple, put a comma separated
list of values in between parentheses.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,953
What about, one element tuples? If we just
put, a value in between parentheses that

19
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:52,543
you says, parenthesize this mathematical
expression, and it get's us back the

20
00:01:52,543 --> 00:01:56,608
value.
To create a one element tuple, put a comma

21
00:01:56,608 --> 00:02:04,920
after the value inside the parentheses.
Empty tuples do not require this comma.
