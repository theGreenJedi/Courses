You've seen how to add two strings and how you can multiply a string
by an int to repeat the string. In this video, we're going to
explore other string operators. We assigned cat to variable solution. Now, we use the two equal symbols to
compare to see if solution refers to cat. There is also a not equal operator that
looks like this with an exclamation mark and the equals symbol. We'll make solution point
to a new string and then examine the same operations. We can compare two strings for
their dictionary order. Here, Python compares letter by
letter starting at the beginning. That was the less than operator. We also have a greater than operator. We have operators less than or equal to
and greater than or equal to as well, and we can compare capital letters. In fact, capitalization matters, and capital letters are less
than lowercase letters. Any letter that you can
type can be compared. We can always compare two values of
different types for equality and inequality, but we usually can't compare
items of two different types for ordering. Here is a new string operator. We can see if one string is
inside another string using in. Using this,
we can check to see if c is a vowel. The order of the letters is important. Zoo is not in ooze. We can ask if the empty string is in
another string, and the answer is yes, and also the empty string is in itself. The last thing we'll discuss in this
lecture is a function, not an operator. Len takes in a string and tells you
how many letters there are in it. The empty string has 0 characters
abracadabra has 11 and the result of this expression has 23.
