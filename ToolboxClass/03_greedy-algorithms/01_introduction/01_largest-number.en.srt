Hi, I'm Michael Levin and
together we will study Greedy Algorithms.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,955
They are some of the simplest
algorithms that exist and

3
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:12,722
they usually seem a pretty natural
way to try solving a problem.

4
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:15,330
We will start with a few
examples of problems that can be

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,190
solved by greedy algorithms,
just to illustrate how they work.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,511
And our very first problem is
a problem about largest number.

7
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:27,019
And for this problem, you will probably be
able to come up with a greedy algorithm

8
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,720
yourself, because that is really
a very natural thing to do.

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,091
So imagine this situation.

10
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:37,674
You are trying to get a job at a company
and you already had a few interviews, and

11
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:39,081
everything went well.

12
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:42,589
Now you have your final
interview with the boss, and

13
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:45,471
he tells you that he
will give you an offer.

14
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:48,509
But instead of negotiating
your salary with you,

15
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:52,500
he will give you a few pieces of
paper with digits written on them.

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,180
And your task will be to arrange
those digits in a row, so

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,890
that when you read the number from left
to right, that will be your salary.

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,920
So basically, you have a problem.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,780
Given a few digits, to arrange them
in the largest possible number.

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,670
And there are a few examples
of such numbers on the slide.

21
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,559
So what do you think will be
the correct answer to this problem?

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,780
And of course,
the correct answer is 997531.

23
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,963
And it's pretty obvious that you should
arrange numbers from the largest to

24
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:28,931
the smallest, from left to right.

25
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:32,520
But let's look at how
the greedy algorithm does that.

26
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,640
So, the Greedy Strategy is start
with a list of digits then

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,641
find the maximum digit in the list.

28
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:47,121
Append it to the number and
remove it from the list.

29
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:52,410
And then repeat this process until
there are no digits left in the list.

30
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,000
So on the next step we will find
the largest digit, which is again 9.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,625
We'll append it to the number to
the right and remove it from the list.

32
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:07,680
Then we will find 7 as the largest
digit appended to the right and

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,300
remove it from the list.

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,550
And then we'll continue with 5, 3, and 1.

35
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,710
And then we get the correct answer,
997531.

36
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,820
And in the next video,
we will design an algorithm

37
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,450
to find the minimum number of refuels
during a long journey by car.

38
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,570
We will see similarities
between these two problems,

39
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,060
largest number problem and
car refueling problem.

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,630
And we will define how greedy
algorithms work in general.
