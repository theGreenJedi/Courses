  Congratulations on completing your first assignment!
 </p>
 <p>
  Hopefully this assignment will have given you the chance to set up and debug your development environment using a really straightforward problem.  As we mentioned, we want to help as many people as possible succeed in this course, and we designed these assignments to
  <em>
   <strong>
    focus you on the process
   </strong>
  </em>
  â€” before you start solving harder, new problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the next step, we will give you a more interesting problem together with a step by step solution. This problem will require us to find a bug in the given naive solution, then to figure out that the naive solution is too slow, to design a faster solution, and to stress test it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remark. In all lectures in this class we do not stick to a particular programming language. Instead, we use pseudocode. In this module, however, we use C++ to illustrate testing techniques as we need to run real programs here. A particular choice of a language is not important here.
