1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,020
Algorithms are everywhere.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,970
Whether you are writing software,
analyzing a genome,

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,540
predicting traffic jams, producing
automatic movie recommendations, or

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,290
just surfing the Internet,
you're dealing with algorithms.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,570
Every single branch of computer
science uses algorithms, so

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,220
a course on algorithms and data structures
is an essential part of any CS curriculum.

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,140
>> It's important that
the algorithms we use are efficient

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,300
as users want to see the search
results in a blink of an eye

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,180
even if they search through
trillions of web pages.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,520
A poorly thought out algorithm could
take literally centuries to process all

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,570
the webpages indexed by a search engine or
all the Facebook posts.

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,980
And thus, algorithmic improvements are
necessary to make these systems practical.

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,100
That's why tech companies
always ask lots of algorithmic

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,440
questions at the interviews.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,710
>> In data science problems,
like ranking internet search results,

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,360
predicting road accidents, and
recommending movies to users,

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,820
advanced algorithms are used to
achieve excellent search quality,

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,591
high prediction accuracy, and
to make relevant recommendations.

19
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:04,940
However, even for a simple machine
learning algorithm like linear regression

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,400
to be able to process big
data is usually a challenge.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,570
When advanced algorithms such as deep
neural networks are applied to

22
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,010
huge data sets they make
extremely accurate predictions.

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,230
Recently starting to even outperform
humans in some areas of vision and

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,060
speech recognition, but
getting those algorithms to work in

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,840
hours instead of years on
a large dataset is hard.

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,690
And performing experiments quickly
is crucial in data science.

27
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,040
>> Algorithms are everywhere.

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,300
Each of trillions of cells in
your body executes a complex and

29
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,790
still poorly understood algorithm.

30
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,878
And algorithm are the key for

31
00:01:42,878 --> 00:01:47,924
solving important biomedical
problems such as what are the mutations

32
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:53,720
that differentiate you from me and
how is it they relate to diseases.

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,470
In this specialization you will learn
the theory behind the algorithm.

34
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,680
Implement algorithm in the programming
language of your choice and apply them

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,180
to solving practical problems such as
assembling the genome from millions

36
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:15,890
of tiny fragments, the largest jigsaw
puzzle ever assembled by humans.

37
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,400
>> To conclude, algorithms are everywhere.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,565
And it is important to design your
algorithms and to implement them.

39
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:25,937
To turn you into a pro in algorithm design
we will give you nearly 100 programming

40
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,980
assignments in this class.

41
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,440
Your solutions will be checked
automatically, and

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,790
you will learn how to implement, test, and

43
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,970
debug fast algorithms solving large and
difficult problems in seconds.

44
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,230
We look forward to seeing
you in this class.

45
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,350
We know it will make you
a better programmer.

46
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,350
>> Algorithms are everywhere.

47
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,390
In fact you just saw five algorithms
solving the fundamental sorting problem

48
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,310
in computer science, and
they all have different running times.

49
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,640
In fact while four of them are about to
finish one will take a much longer time.

50
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,387
In this specialization you'll be able to
implement all of these algorithms, and

51
00:03:04,387 --> 00:03:07,346
master the skill of answering
both algorithmic and

52
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:10,191
programming questions
at your next interview.
