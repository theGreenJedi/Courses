00:00:00,858 --> 00:00:03,558
Hello everybody,
welcome to the course on graph algorithms.

2
00:00:03,558 --> 00:00:07,011
The first unit in this course,
we're going to be talking about various

3
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:10,418
algorithms to compute various
sorts of decompositions of graphs.

4
00:00:10,418 --> 00:00:11,595
But to begin with,

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:15,421
we're going to start with the very
basics about what is a graph,

6
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:19,998
what are they good for, and how do we
sort of interpret them and draw them.

7
00:00:19,998 --> 00:00:24,561
So to start with,
a graph is sort of an abstract idea, and

8
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:30,758
it's an abstraction that sort of
represents connections between objects.

9
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:34,525
Graphs are useful both in computer
science and elsewhere in the world,

10
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:37,938
because they can be used to
describe many important phenomena.

11
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:41,148
For example, the Internet often
can be thought of as a graph,

12
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:45,376
where you've got various web pages and
theyre connected to each other by links.

13
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:49,124
And this is sort of a very, very high
level view of the Internet that sort

14
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:53,196
of pays no attention to the content of
a given page and other things like that.

15
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:54,293
On the other hand,

16
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:59,025
if you want to do something like Google's
page rank algorithm, make sort of heavy

17
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:03,434
use of this very high level view of
the Internet and connectivity within it.

18
00:01:03,434 --> 00:01:06,425
Another example is maps,
you can think of maps as a graph,

19
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:09,854
sort of where you have intersections
that are connected by roads.

20
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:12,559
And this is a view that would
be very useful if you, say,

21
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:14,874
wanted to plot a course
between two locations.

22
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,738
You need to find some connections,

23
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:22,994
some path along this map that gets
you from one place to the other.

24
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:25,352
Social networks can also
be interpreted as graphs.

25
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:29,732
You have people connected by friendships
or following relationship or

26
00:01:29,732 --> 00:01:34,112
whatever, and this provides you
another example of graph structure.

27
00:01:34,112 --> 00:01:36,745
You can also sort of use
more complicated things,

28
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:40,892
if you have some sort of robot arm that
can be in many possible configurations.

29
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,914
What you could do is,
you could think of the configurations,

30
00:01:43,914 --> 00:01:46,890
some of them are connected to
each other by various motions.

31
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,692
And then if you want to
solve problems like,

32
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:54,996
how do I best reconfigure this robot arm
from this position to this other position,

33
00:01:54,996 --> 00:01:59,845
you again, want to sort of consider
this graph relating these things to each

34
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:02,910
other in order to figure
out how best to do that.

35
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,266
Okay, so these are the sorts of problems
that we would like to be able to deal with

36
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:08,450
using graph theory.

37
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,490
So what is a graph?

38
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,398
Well, the formal definition of an
undirected graph we'll talk about directed

39
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:19,290
ones in a few lectures is that
it's a collection V of vertices.

40
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,630
And then a collection E of edges,

41
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,570
each of which connects a pair
of vertices to each other.

42
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,897
So when you draw them on the paper what
you do is your verses are usually drawn as

43
00:02:29,897 --> 00:02:31,770
points or circles or something.

44
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,452
And the edges are lines or curves or

45
00:02:34,452 --> 00:02:38,067
something that connect
pairs of these point.

46
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:43,694
So for example the graph drawn on
the screen has four Vertices labelled A,

47
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:48,044
B, C, and D and it also has
four edges one between A and B,

48
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:52,806
one between A and C, one between A and
D and one between C and D.

49
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,250
And so to make sure that
were all in the same page in

50
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,806
we draw the following graph below,
how many edges does it have?

51
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,924
Well, the graph here has 12 edges.

52
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:04,695
You can sort of count them all and

53
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:08,444
each of these segments between two
of these points gives us an edge.

54
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:11,304
And so, there are 12 of them.

55
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:16,097
Now, there's one thing that sort of
fits into this definition of graphs that

56
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:19,504
I gave that is a little bit weird perhaps,
or unusual.

57
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:21,880
One thing that you might have is loops,

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,204
this would be an edge that
connects a vertex to itself.

59
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:30,024
So here we just have the one vertex A, and
then a loop that connects A to itself.

60
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:32,764
And there are some instances in
which you might want to use this.

61
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:36,995
Sometimes you actually do have traffic
circle that just goes in a loop or

62
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:38,344
something like that.

63
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:43,182
But only sometimes this is the sort
of a thing we we're talking about.

64
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:48,442
Also sometimes you can have multiple
edges between the same pair of vertices.

65
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:53,640
So in this picture we have two vertices
A and B and two edges between them.

66
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,940
And somehow if you're just talking about,
can I get from A to B?

67
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,778
It doesn't matter if there's one edge or
two between them.

68
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:04,598
But sometimes having
both of them is relevant.

69
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:07,202
On the other hand a lot of the time,
these loops and

70
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:11,498
multiple edges are just a sort of a that
we don't really need to deal with.

71
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:14,057
So often times you work
with what are known as

72
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:18,218
simple graphs which don't have loops and
don't have multiple edges.

73
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:22,978
And so, this is sort of the basics of
what a graph is that we've just covered.

74
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:25,518
Next time we're going to talk
about a couple of things.

75
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:29,584
First thing we're going to talk about how
to represent graphs on a computer and

76
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:33,458
then we're going to talk a little bit
about how we talk about runtimes for

77
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,558
graph algorithms.

78
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,896
So I hope this has been
a useful introduction and

79
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:40,410
I'll see you at the next lecture when
we talk about these other things.
