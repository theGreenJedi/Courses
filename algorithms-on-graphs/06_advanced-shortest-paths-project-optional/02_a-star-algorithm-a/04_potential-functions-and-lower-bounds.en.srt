00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,830
Hi, in the previous videos we've
introduced a new algorithm called A*, and

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,950
we even created it's
bidirectional version.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,830
But this all was somewhat abstract because
to implement this algorithm in practice,

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,710
we need some potential function.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,160
And we don't know yet
where to get that potential function so

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,640
that it is feasible and good enough.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,840
So first we'll prove a Lemma.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,295
Remember we were talking
about lower bounds,

9
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:32,995
we were talking that most of the time,
potential function of a vertex

10
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:37,425
is a lower bound on the distance
between this vertex and the target.

11
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:41,735
So now we'll prove that actually if
potential function is feasible, and

12
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:45,815
the potential of the target
vertex is less than or

13
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:50,575
equal to 0, then this potential
function is indeed a lower bound

14
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:54,580
on the distance between the current vertex
and the target vertex for any vertex v.

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,673
To prove that,
we should know that first l pi of (x,y) is

16
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:05,938
non-negative for any x,y if pi is
feasible, by definition of feasibility.

17
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:10,680
And so also l pi of any path p,

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,094
the length of any path in the new
graph is also non-negative.

19
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:21,480
Then, we take any shortest path
between v and t, and call it P.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,470
And then we know that zero is less than or
equal to the length of this path

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,430
because the length of each path
in the new graph is non-negative.

22
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,040
And this length of
the path in the new graph

23
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,580
is equal to the length of
the path in the initial graph

24
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:41,000
minus the potential of the vertex v
plus the potential of the target vertex.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,750
But now remember that potential of
the target vertex is non-positive.

26
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,226
So, this is less than or
equal to length of the path and

27
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:54,914
initial graph minus potential of vertex v.

28
00:01:54,914 --> 00:02:00,590
And we know that this final expression
is bigger than or equal to zero.

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,260
Which means, in turn,
that the potential of v is less than or

30
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,500
equal to the length of
the path in the initial graph.

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,490
Which is the shortest path between v and
t, so

32
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,670
it is equal to the distance from from
v to t, so we've proven our Lemma.

33
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:20,005
Now it's time to introduce at
least one specific potential, and

34
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:23,285
we'll start with the one we
already discussed several times,

35
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:27,130
we'll just prove that this is
really a good physical potential.

36
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,770
So we consider a road
network on a plane map

37
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,270
where any vertex has its coordinates x and
y.

38
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,600
Then the potential given
by Euclidean distance and

39
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,490
the Euclidean distance between two points
is basically the length of a line segment

40
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,430
connecting those two points.

41
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,350
It is given by the form of pi of v is
equal to the Euclidean distance from v

42
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,890
to the target.

43
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,700
Which is in turn equal to the square root

44
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,260
of the sum of squares of differences
of the coordinates of v and the target.

45
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,750
So we stated this
potential is feasible and

46
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,260
that the potential of
the target vertex is zero.

47
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,440
And if we prove this Lemma this in turn
means that given the previous Lemma

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,720
that this potential is always
a lower bound on the actual distance

49
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,200
in this road network from v to the target.

50
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,250
But this is also obvious in self
because this potential is equal

51
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,000
to the straight line segment
length between v and the target.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,990
And of course no path in the road network
and be shorter then the length of

53
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,888
the straight lines segment between
current vertex and the target vertex.

54
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:35,400
So our previous Lemma
makes sense in this case.

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,100
Now lets prove that this
is a good potential.

56
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,812
So, we know for any edge (u,v) the length
of this edge is greater then or equal to

57
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:49,032
the Euclidean potential to the Euclidean
distance between these two nodes.

58
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:53,668
Because segment is the shortest path
between two points on the plane.

59
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:58,673
Now we see that the potential of
any node u, is equal by definition

60
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:04,530
to the Euclidean distance between
this node u and the target node.

61
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,480
And then we can use the triangle
inequality for the Euclidean distance,

62
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,240
to state that the Euclidean distance
between u and t is less than or

63
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,460
equal to the distance between u and
v, plus the distance between v and t.

64
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,020
Now we know that the Euclidean distance
between u and v is less than or

65
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,990
equal to the length of
the edge between u and v.

66
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,430
And the Euclidean distance between v and
t is exactly equal to the potential of v.

67
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,510
So we see that pi(u) is less than or
equal to l(u,v) + pi(v).

68
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:43,480
And we can write this as l (u,
v)- pi (u) + pi (v) is non-negative.

69
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,610
And this is by definition the length

70
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,060
of the edge in the new graph
with new edge weights.

71
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,730
And we see that all the edge weights
in the new graph are non-negative.

72
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,000
And that's why the potential
pi is really feasible.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,250
And also it's obvious that the potential
of the target vertex is zero because it's

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,070
basically the distance from the target
vertex to itself and it is equal to zero.

75
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:17,090
So to implement an actual specific
A* algorithm on a plane map,

76
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,100
we need to find the shortest path from
source vertex to the target vertex,

77
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,620
so for each node v we can compute,
either pre compute or

78
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,550
compute on the fly, the potential.

79
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,930
Which is equal to the Euclidean
distance from v to d,

80
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,640
to do that we just need the coordinates
of v and coordinates of t and

81
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,120
this computation works in constant time.

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,430
And then we just launch Dijkstra's
algorithm with potentials pi of v, and

83
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,786
this will be our A star.

84
00:05:44,786 --> 00:05:48,437
And even with Euclidean
distance potential,

85
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:53,950
this will work faster than
the regular Dijkstra's algorithm.

86
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,612
And you will see that in one of
the problems of this project.
