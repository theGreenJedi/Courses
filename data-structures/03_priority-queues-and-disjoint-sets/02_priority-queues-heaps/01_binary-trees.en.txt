Hello. In this lesson we will consider
binary heaps in full detail. A binary heap is one of the most common
ways of implementing a priority queue. So just by definition a max binary heap is
a binary tree where each node has zero, one, or two children where the following
property is satisfied for each node. The value of the node is at least
the value of all its children. Or, put it otherwise, if you take any
edge in this tree, then the value of its top end is at least
the value of its bottom end. So this is an example of a binary
max heap, and it can be easily checked that this property is satisfied
on all the edges of this tree. On the other hand,
this is an example of a binary tree, which is not a binary max heap. And this is why. Here, we have five edges where
the property is violated. For example, we see that on this top edge
while it's the value of its top end is 10 while the value of
its bottom end is 25. And there are four other edges
where the property is violated.
