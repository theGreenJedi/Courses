Hello.

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:06,070
In this lesson we will consider
binary heaps in full detail.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:13,360
A binary heap is one of the most common
ways of implementing a priority queue.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,129
So just by definition a max binary heap is
a binary tree where each node has zero,

5
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:26,626
one, or two children where the following
property is satisfied for each node.

6
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:33,420
The value of the node is at least
the value of all its children.

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,730
Or, put it otherwise, if you take any
edge in this tree, then the value

8
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,670
of its top end is at least
the value of its bottom end.

9
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,560
So this is an example of a binary
max heap, and it can be easily

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,490
checked that this property is satisfied
on all the edges of this tree.

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,165
On the other hand,
this is an example of a binary tree,

12
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:04,215
which is not a binary max heap.

13
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:05,215
And this is why.

14
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:08,915
Here, we have five edges where
the property is violated.

15
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:13,856
For example, we see that on this top edge
while it's the value of its top end is

16
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:16,837
10 while the value of
its bottom end is 25.

17
00:01:16,837 --> 00:01:21,822
And there are four other edges
where the property is violated.
