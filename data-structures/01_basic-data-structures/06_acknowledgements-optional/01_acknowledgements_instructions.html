  First of all, we thank you, the learners of this class, for you are the reason we're working on this Course and this
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algo">
   Specialization
  </a>
  . We admire the effort you put in absorbing the material and, if you're working on the Programming Assignments, your determination to pass them despite all the traps we've prepared for you :) Thank you for asking good questions on the forums and helping each other to learn more and deeper.
 </p>
 <p>
  We thank our colleagues who helped us with preparing problems for the programming assignments, including problem statements, test suites, solutions, starter files, etc.: Maxim Akhmedov, Roman Andreev, Gleb Evstropov, Nikolai Karpov, Sergey Kopeliovich, Ilya Kornakov, Gennady Korotkevich, Paul Melnichuk, Alexander Tiunov.
 </p>
 <p>
  We thank our colleagues who helped us with preparing the Capstone Project, including selecting the topic, implementing the algorithms, implementing the visualizers, finding input data, testing, etc.: Ruslan Savchenko, Vitaly Osipov.
 </p>
 <p>
  Phillip Compeau co-authored the materials covering some sections of this specialization, including various parts covering dynamic programming and combinatorial pattern matching.
