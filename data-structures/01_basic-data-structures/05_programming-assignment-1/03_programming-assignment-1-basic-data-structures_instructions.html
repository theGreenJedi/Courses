  Welcome to your first programming assignment in the Data Structures course of the
  <a href="https://goo.gl/mtuRzg">
   Data Structures and Algorithms
  </a>
  Specialization!
 </p>
 <p>
  You will be practicing implementing basic data structures and using them to solve algorithmic problems. In some of the problems, you just need to implement and use a data structure from the lectures, while in the others you will also need to invent an algorithm to solve the problem using some of the basic data structures.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this programming assignment, the grader will show you the input and output data if your solution fails on
  <em>
   any of the tests
  </em>
  . This is done to help you to get used to the algorithmic problems involving data structures in general and get some experience debugging your programs while knowing exactly on which tests they fail. However, for all the following programming assignments, the grader will show the input data only in case your solution fails on one of the first few tests (please review the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/supplement/BV56e/faq-on-programming-assignments">
   FAQ section
  </a>
  for a more detailed explanation of this behavior of the grader).
